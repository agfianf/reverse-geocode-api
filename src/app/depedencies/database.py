    This dependency function provides an AsyncConnection within a transaction context.
    The transaction is automatically committed if the function using this connection
    completes successfully, or rolled back if an SQLAlchemyError occurs.

    Yields:
        AsyncConnection: An asynchronous SQLAlchemy connection object with an active transaction.

    Raises:
        SQLAlchemyError: If any database-related error occurs during the transaction.

    Example:
        ```
        @app.get("/example")
        async def example_endpoint(
            conn: AsyncConnection = Depends(get_async_transaction_conn),
