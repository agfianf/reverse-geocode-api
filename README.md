# Reverse Geocode Indonesia

Reverse Geocode Indonesia is you give latitude and longitude, this API will return the address in Indonesia (Kecamatan, Kabupaten, Provinsi, dan Negara). We use this because there is a need to hit this  with > 1req/second. This is usually used for geocoding in Indonesia. This API is not perfect, but it is good enough for most use cases.
